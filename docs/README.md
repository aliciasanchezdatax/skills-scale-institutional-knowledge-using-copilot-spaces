# OctoAcme Project Management Processes

OctoAcme's project management processes are designed to deliver customer-centric outcomes through iterative, highly collaborative workflows. The typical lifecycle follows five main stages: initiation, planning, execution, release, and retrospective. During initiation, the team defines the business need, key success metrics, stakeholders, an initial timeline, and risks, documenting the information in a Project One-pager for clarity and alignment. Planning breaks down work into actionable backlog items, establishes milestones, and documents the Definition of Done and test plans, ensuring every objective is clearly tied to measurable acceptance criteria and prioritization. The execution and tracking phase is supported by regular standups, delivery syncs, and sprint demos, using visual project boards such as GitHub Projects to monitor item status from backlog through deployment.

Roles and responsibilities are clearly defined and guide collaboration throughout the project lifecycle. The Project Manager coordinates delivery and communication, mitigating risks and keeping schedules on track, while the Product Manager focuses on defining business goals, prioritizing work, and validating outcomes through metrics and user insights. Developers work closely with product and project leads to deliver features that meet acceptance criteria, drive technical quality, and surface risks. Quality assurance, whether manual or automated, is a shared responsibility that emphasizes clear test coverage, code reviews, and security scanning in continuous integration (CI) pipelines.

Communication is prioritized as a cornerstone of OctoAcme's practices. Regular touchpoints include daily standups for the delivery team, weekly syncs between Project and Product Managers, and monthly stakeholder updates to maintain transparency and customer alignment. Risk management is integrated into weekly rhythms, with escalation paths defined from the delivery team to sponsors or cross-team collaboration as needed. All major decisions, risks, and progress updates are documented and shared in accessible formats such as the project README and communication templates.

Each release undergoes a rigorous checklist to minimize deployment risks, including verification of testing, backup procedures, release note drafting, and incident response planning. After releases and at the end of each significant milestone, teams hold retrospectives to capture learnings, promote continuous improvement, and document actionable items with clear owners and timelines. This cycle of iterative delivery, clearly defined roles, shared risk and communication standards, and quality-focused practices fosters both accountability and rapid value delivery across OctoAcme projects.
